Your Mother Should Know

Let’s all get up and dance to a song
That was a hit before your mother was born.
Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should...)
Your mother should know (...know.)
Sing it again.

Though she was born a long, long time ago

Lift up your hearts and sing me a song

Though she was born a long, long time ago
Your mother should know (Your mother should...)
Your mother should know (Aaaah.)

Your mother should know (Yeah.)
Your mother should know (Your mother should...)
Your mother should know (Yeah.)
