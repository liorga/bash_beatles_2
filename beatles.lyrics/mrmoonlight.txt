Mr. Moonlight

Mr. Moonlight
You came to me one summernight and from your beam you made my dream,
And from the world you sent my girl and from above you sent us love,
And now she’s mine.
I think you’re fine ‘cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight.
Mr. Moonlight, come again please, here I am on my knees,
Begging if you please, and the nights you don’t come my way.
I’ll pray and pray more each day, ‘cause we love you, Mr. Moonlight,
Mr. Moonlight.
