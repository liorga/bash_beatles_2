You Really Got A Hold On Me

I don’t like you
But I love you
See that I’m always
Thinking of you
Oh, oh, oh,
You treat me badly
I love you madly
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me, baby
I don’t want you,
But I need you
Don’t want to kiss you
But I need you
Oh, oh, oh
You do me wring now
My love is strong now
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
I want to leave you
Don’t want to stay here
Don’t want to spend
Another day here
Oh, oh, oh, I want to split now
I just can quit now
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me, baby
I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
You’ve really got a hold on me
You’ve really got a hold on me
