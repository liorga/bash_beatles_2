She Loves You

She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you lost your love,
When I saw her yesterday.
It’s you she’s thinking of
And she told me what to say.
She says she loves you
And you know that can’t be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind.
She said to let you know
You’re not the hurting kind.
She says she loves you
And you know that can’t be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
And now it’s up to you,
I think it’s only fair,
Pride can hurt you, too,
Apologize to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can’t be bad.
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad. Ooh!
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
And with a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that
You know you should be glad.
With a love like that,
You know you sho-o-ould
Be Glad!
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah Ye-ah.
