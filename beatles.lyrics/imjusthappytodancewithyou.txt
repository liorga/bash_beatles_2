I'm Just Happy To Dance With You

Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want or need to hold your hand
Well it's only try and understand
'cause there's really nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to kiss or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause Iâ€™m happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
It's everything I need
I discovered I'm in love with you
'cause I'm happy just to dance with you
