Everybody's Trying To Be My Baby

Well they took some honey from the tree,
dressed it up and they called it me.
Everybody's trying to be my baby, everybody's trying to be my baby,
Everybody's trying to be my baby now.
Woke up last night, half past four,
Wicked woman knocking at my door.
Went out last night, I didn't stay late,
Called her home, had a nice teen date.
