I Call Your Name

I call your name but you're not there, was I to blame for being unfair,
Oh I can't sleep at night, since you've been gone. I never
Weep at night I can't go on.
Well don't you know I can't take it. I don't know who can,
I'm not goin' to mayayake it I'm not that kind of man.
Oh I can't sleep at night, but just the same I never weep at
Night I call your name, I call your name.
