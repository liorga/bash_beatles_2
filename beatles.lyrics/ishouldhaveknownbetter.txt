I Should Have Known Better

I should have known better with a girl like you, that I
Would love everything that you do; and I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do.
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be, this could
Only happen to me; can't you see, can't you see,
That when I tell you that I love you, oh, you're gonna say
You love me too, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo, oh,
And when I ask you to be mine, you're gonna say you love me
Too. You love me too, you love me too.
